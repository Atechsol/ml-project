This repository contains a dataset related to loan applications and Python code for building various machine learning models to predict loan eligibility.

Dataset:

The data.csv file contains information about loan applicants, including features like:

Applicant characteristics: Age, income, credit score, etc.
Loan details: Loan amount, loan term, etc.
Loan status: Whether the loan was approved or rejected (binary classification)
Machine Learning Models:

This project includes code to build and evaluate the following models for loan eligibility prediction:

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): An artificial neural network capable of learning complex patterns in the data.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the similarity to their neighbors.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm for classification problems that aims to find the optimal hyperplane separating the classes.
Evaluation Metric:

Gini Index: Used to measure the impurity of a classification model, where a lower value indicates better separation between classes.
Visualization:

Tree plots: Visualize the decision-making process of the Random Forest model for better understanding and interpretation.
Note:

This is a basic template, and you might need to:

Install required libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc. (refer to the code for specific libraries used).
Adjust hyperparameters and explore additional models or evaluation metrics based on your specific needs.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries.
Run the Python script (train_models.py) to train and evaluate the models.
Analyze the results and generated visualizations (e.g., gini scores, tree plots).
